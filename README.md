# Project Title

Create and Mint Token

## Description

This solidity code is the solution to the assessment of the "ETH PROOF: Intermediate ETH + AVAX Course" by Metacrafters. The requirements of the assessment are:

For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own token on a local HardHat network. Once you have your contract, you should be able to use remix to interact with it. From remix, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-boilerplate
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `npx hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Clear activity tab data`.

## Setting up your editor
